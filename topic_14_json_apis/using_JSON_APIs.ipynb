    "\n",
    "JSON is the most widely format for data interchange on the web. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.\n",

    "* Machine Parsable - JSON is easy to parse and generate for computers.\n",
    "* JSON is language independent.\n",
    "* JSON is \"self-describing\" and easy to understand.\n",
    "* JSON is built on two structures:\n",
    "    * A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\n",
    "    * An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n",
